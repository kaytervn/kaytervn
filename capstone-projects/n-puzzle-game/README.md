| **Summary**       |This Python programming application utilizes the tkinter graphics library and is built following a functional source code structure. It involves creating an N-Puzzle game using AI algorithms, including global search methods (informed and uninformed) and local search, combined with heuristic distance estimation functions. This allows for observations and evaluations of the effectiveness of each used algorithm.|
