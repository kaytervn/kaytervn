| **Summary**       |This Winform program, developed in C# on the ASP.NET platform using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, utilizes Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 for its database. The project includes steps such as describing the business problem, designing the database, and establishing data constraints. Techniques under the database layer involve creating triggers, views, procedures, functions, and setting up roles with granted permissions. The convenience store application encompasses functionalities such as rolebased login, employee and product management (inventory and store release), revenue statistics, payroll calculation, work shift attendance tracking, and viewing detailed invoices.|
