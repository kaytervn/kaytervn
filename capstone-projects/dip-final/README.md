| **1** | Face Detection              | Face recognition, with a minimum of 5 individuals. Within a single frame, there must be multiple individuals with their names labeled.                |
| **2** | Object Detection            | Recognition of 5 object classes using YOLOv8, trained on Google Colab. The 5 objects selected are capybara, hedgehog, raccoon, kangaroo, and penguin. |
| **3** | Handwritten Digit Detection | Handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.                                                                                                |
| **4** | Image Processing            | Various chapters on image processing.                                                                                                                 |
| **5** | Hand Gesture Detection      | Additionally, we have implemented hand gesture recognition, including gestures such as open hand, closed hand, heart symbol, OK sign, and thumbs up.  |
