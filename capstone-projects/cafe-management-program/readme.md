| **Summary**       |This project is programmed in three programming languages: C#, Java, C++. Apply basic object-oriented properties such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with virtual methods, interfaces, operator overloading, and additional procedures for adding/removing/editing. Simulate a coffee shop management program with features like login and permission management for admin and staff. Admins can handle personnel management and sales statistics, while staff can place orders for each table and process payments.|
