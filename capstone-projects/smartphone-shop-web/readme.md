| **Summary**       |This web application employs Java Servlets, follows the MVC model, utilizes the Hibernate framework, incorporates the Java Mail module, and uses the JSTL taglib library. It connects to a MySQL database and is deployed on Render. The e-commerce website has two user types: regular users and administrators. Regular users have basic functionalities such as logging in, registering, adding items to the cart, making payments, and receiving order confirmation emails. Administrators, on the other hand, have tasks like managing products, user administration, and overseeing orders.|
